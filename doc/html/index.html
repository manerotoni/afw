<h1>CellAnnotator</h1>

<p> CellAnnotator is an interactive tool for supervised
classifier training.
It's operating on image galleries or thumbnails rather than on
microscope images. Therefore it is working on preprocessed image data.
The term <span style="font-style: italic;">preprocessed</span>
mean that raw images are segmented and for each forground object i.e.
cell the feature vector, the thumbnail, bounding box and outline
is&nbsp;calculated. Therfore a cell is represented by its
numerical data and the thumbnail is only the visualisation in the
graphical user interface (GUI).</p>

<h2>Key features</h2>
<h4>Interactivity</h4>
The strenght of &nbsp;CellAnnotator lies in its interactivitiy. The
immediate feedback decreases the effort of training and validation to a
few minutes. Validation is performed using cross validatiaon. The
immedate feedback i.e. the classification result enables even
unexperienced users to evaluate the classifier visually.<br>
<h4>Gallery Viewer</h4>
The main widget&nbsp;is the gallery viewer which centered in the
middle of the GUI. It is possible to adjust the view by toggling the
outlines and background mask and turning on/off &nbsp;indicators
for classification results. Standard functionality such as zooming an
contrast enhancemend is also provided.<br>
<br>
<h4>Multiple color support</h4>
CellAnnotator is always working
on multiple channels. This means if the raw images were red and green,
the viewer shows both colors. If the raw images were only grey, the
viewer shows only grey. Particularly it means that the feature vectors
of the single channels are always concatenated to a combined feature
vector and a classifier is alway working on the concatenated feature
vector. &nbsp;The feature set is the same as in the <a href="www.cellcognition.org">Cellcognition project</a><br>

which is documented <a href="www.doc.cellcognition.org">here</a>.<br>

<h4>Sorting and ranking:</h4>

To train a classifier&nbsp;it is necessary to provide&nbsp;a sufficient number of training examples i.e. cells that
represent a certain cell morphology. &nbsp;The search &nbsp;for
a proper training set is usually time consuming and tedius.
CellAnnotator addresses this problem by sorting and ranking the image
gallery by similarity measures of the feature vectors. If one example
of a phenotype is found, the gallery can be sorted, and similar
objects are presented beside each other to the user.<br>

<br>

<h4>Classifier training:</h4>

Training of a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">Support
Vector Machine</a>&nbsp;consistst of three parts. First find the proper
class definition, second annotate the training samples and last but not
least validate the classifier. Validation is achived by&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_%28statistics%29">cross
validation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization#Grid_search">grid
search</a>, standard methods for support vector classifiers.
&nbsp;Defining the classes and annoation is usually an iterative
procedure. This is the strength of CellAnnotator. The user starts for
example with interphase + mitotic and annotates examples. After grid
search the predicted classes are indicated for each cell object and it
is possible to correct for classification and
annotation&nbsp;errors or add/remove&nbsp;classes to the
definition. <br>
<br>
<h4>Data import:</h4>
The data importer preprocesses the raw images. It implements a standard
pipline i.e. segmentation for forground background separation,
calculation of outlines (contours), bounding boxes, thumbnails and last
but not least the feature vectors. &nbsp;The data is saved in hdf5
format, optimized for fast reading. CellAnnotator can also read data
from cellh5.<br>
